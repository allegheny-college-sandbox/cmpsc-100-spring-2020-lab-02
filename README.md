# CMPSC 100-02 Lab Session 2: G. Wiz and his crystal ball

* Assigned: 23 January 2020
* Due: 30 January 2020 by 2:30 PM
* Point value: 20

This lab session explores program "flow of control," code syntax, and legibility. While you are not necessarily doing any "original" programming in this assignment, this task relies on some basic knowledge about Java programming that we've covered in class. In addition, we will learn or continue practicing:

* [Slack](https://cmpsc-100-02-sp-2020.slack.com)
* [GitHub](https://www.github.com)
* git
* Markdown
* [Atom](https://atom.io)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* GatorGrader
* gradle

## General guidelines for laboratory sessions

* **Follow steps carefully.** Laboratory sessions often get a bit more complicated than their preceeding Practical sessions. Especially for early sessions which expose you to platforms with which you may not be familiar, take notes on `command`s you run and their corresponding effects/outputs. If you find yourself stuck on a step, let a TL or the professor know! Laboratory sessions do not mean that we won't help you in the same way we do during Practicals.
* **Regularly ask and answer questions.** Some of you may have more experience with the topics we're discussing than others. We can use this knowledge to our advantage. But, like in Practicals, let students try things for a while before offering help (**always _offer_ first**). To ask questions, use our [Slack](https://cmpsc-100-02-sp-2020.slack.com)'s `#labs` channel.
* **Store and transfer files using GitHub.** Various forms of file storage are more or less volatile. *You* are responsible for backing up and storing files. If you're unsure of files which have been changed, you can always type `git status` in the terminal for your working folder to determine what you need to back up.
* **Keep all of your files.** See above, but also remember that you're responsible for the files you create.
* **Back up your files regularly.** See above (and above-above).
* **Review the [Honor Code](https://sites.allegheny.edu/about/honor-code/) regularly when working.** If you're taking a solution from another student or the Internet at-large (_especially_ [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com)), bear in mind that using these solutions _can_ constitute a form of plagiarism that violates the Allegheny Honor Code. While it may seem easy and convenient to use these sources, it is equally easy and convenient to rely on them and create bad habits which include not attributing credit or relying exclusively on others to solve issues. Neither are productive uses of your intellect. Really.

## Further helpful reading for this assignment

I recommend reading the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com) which GitHub makes available. In particular, the guides:

* [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
* [Documenting your projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/)
* [GitHub Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)

## Evaluation

This assignment will be evaluated based on completeness. Completing the following objectives indicates that you've done all the steps!

- [ ] Installed `git`
- [ ] Moved the images in the activity to the correct folder
- [ ] Successfully completed a `clone` and `push` operation

## Accepting the assignment

- [ ] Log into the `#labs` channel in our class [Slack](https://cmpsc-100-02-sp-2020.slack.com)
- [ ] Click the link provided for the lab assignment and accept it in GitHub classroom
- [ ] Once the assignment finishes building, click the link to go to your personal repository assignment

## "Cloning" a repository

### Using the correct download link

- [ ] On this repository's page, click the `Clone or download` button in the upper right hand corner
* You may need to scroll up to see it
- [ ] In the upper right corner of the box that appears, click `Use SSH`
- [ ] Copy the link that appears in the textbox below the phrase "Use a password with a protected key."

### Cloning

- [ ] Type `ls` in your terminal window
* You should be in your `CMPSC100` directory
- [ ] Change directories (`cd`) to your `Labs` folder
- [ ] Once in the labs folder, "clone" the repository using the link copied above
* If I (the instructor) were to clone my own repository, I'd enter (your link will look different):
```
git clone git@github.com:allegheny-college-cmpsc-100-spring-2020/cmpsc-100-spring-2020-lab-02-dluman
```

## GatorGrader

### Docker `container`

- [ ] In a terminal window, type `docker pull gatoreducator/dockagator` to download the correct `container`.

#### Running GatorGrader directly on `container` start

* Be sure that you are in the main directory of your lab repository when running these commands, or you'll certainly experience issues!
    * Remember, the folder containing your work is located on the desktop.
* Remember that if you run `ls -la`, you should see a `.git` folder if you're in the main repository folder.
- [ ] To make sure you're in the right repository, type `pwd` and press `Enter`
    * If you recieve the expected path, you're in the right place!

```
docker run -it --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target="/project" --hostname GatorGrader gatoreducator/dockagator
```

#### Run `gradle` commands in the container`

```
docker run -it --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target="/project" --hostname GatorGrader gatoreducator/dockagator bash
```

- [ ] To `build` your Java work, type `gradle build` at the `command` prompt and press the `Enter` key.
- [ ] To `grade` your Java work, type `gradle grade` at the `command` prompt and press the `Enter` key.

## Submitting the assignment/saving progress

The GitHub platform is a place to store your work. So, it makes some sense that should be able to _clone_ (download) from it, and push back (upload) to it. Here, we'll learn this second part.

- [ ] `cd` to your folder containing this lab in your `~/Desktop/CMPSC100/Labs` or `~/OneDrive/Desktop/CMSPC100/Labs` directory

Once in this folder, we need to tell git that there have been changes.

- [ ] Type `git add .` and press `Enter`
* This tells git to look through the _entire_ folder structure for new changes and "stage" them

- [ ] Type `git commit -m "{Commit message}"` to "label" the commit
* This is typically something like `git commit -m "Fixing a typo"` -- the message in quotes should be as descriptive as possible, while still remaining somewhat short

- [ ] To send all changes to the server, type `git push`
- [ ] At the prompt, input the password associated with the `SSH Key` you created earlier in this exercise (yesterday)

Once the process finishes successfully, we're done!
